## Agile
An Agile framework is a structured approach based on taking an iterative approach to  project management. [Joseph A. Griffin](https://cps.northeastern.edu/faculty/joseph-griffin/)  said 'Think of Agile broadly as a guiding orientation for how we approach project work.'

Scrum is a specific methodology of agile, sometimes called Agile Scrum. An important aspect of Scrum is its roles, Alongside the developers  is the Scrum Master who organises meeting and insures that all developers adhere to the Scrum methodology. More seniorly is the Product Owner who sets out the vision, builds the gap between the stakeholders and developers.
