# All companies are fictional and for the purpose of the project


# A brief outline made by Copilot
# Paragon operates across multiple UK cities (Bristol, Cardiff, London, Manchester) and faces operational inefficiencies due to decentralized, paper-based systems.
# The goal is to build a scalable, secure, and user-friendly software solution that centralizes operations, enforces role-based access, and supports real-time reporting and tenant interaction.
